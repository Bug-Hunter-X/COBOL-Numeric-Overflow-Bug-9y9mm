This repository demonstrates a common COBOL numeric overflow bug and its solution.  COBOL's fixed-length numeric fields can lead to unexpected errors if the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the field's capacity. The 'bug.cob' file shows the problematic code, while 'bugSolution.cob' provides the corrected version with a field size that accurately accommodates the potential sum.
